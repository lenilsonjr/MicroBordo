# MicroBordo
MicroBordo is a small software to help people get notes and thoughts into "paper", organized by tags.
It's like a private Twitter.

**To-do:**
- Improve security;
- Solve some bugs;
- Apply "good practices" into the code;
- Improve design.

## How it works?
Come back other day...

## How can I contribute?
You already know how to do it.
